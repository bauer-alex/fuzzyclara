Description: The 'fuzzyclara' package tackles two issues of cluster analysis applications.
  First, it includes routines for fuzzy clustering which avoid the common hard clustering assumption
  that each observation is a clear member of one sole cluster. Instead, membership probabilities indicate
  to which extent the characteristics of each observation are shaped by the characteristics of several
  'typical' clusters. Second, the estimation of classical clustering algorithms is often only hardly or
  not at all feasible in large data situations with thousands of observations. Subsampling-based algorithms
  building on the CLARA algorithm are implemented to make the estimation feasible in such situations.
  Building on these two points, the 'fuzzyclara' package offers routines for all aspects of a cluster
  analysis, including the use of user-defined distance functions and diverse visualization techniques.
